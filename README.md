Project Scope:
I chose the TTC Bus Delay dataset from open.toronto.ca. This dataset
is a rich source of information that can help us understand the
reasons behind bus delays in Toronto. The dataset contains 34981
rows and 10 columns, covering the period from 1 January 2023 to 31
August 2023. There are several variables in the dataset that are of
interest, including date, route, time, day, location, incident, min delay,
min gap, direction, vehicle. By analyzing this dataset, I hope to gain
valuable insights into the factors that contribute to bus delays in
Toronto.

Looking for 3 answers:
Q1) What is the predominant factor contributing to delays
in the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) bus system?
Q2) Are there any noticeable patterns in specific routes and days of the week, that
experience substantial delays, which could inform strategies for enhancements or
schedule adjustments?
Q3) To what extent are delays in the TTC bus system influenced by seasonal
variations?

Key Findings:
● The most common reason for a delay is
Mechanical and majority of the delays are of
less than 125 minutes.
● Diversion has the most delay time followed by
Mechanical and Operation - Operator, indicating
a need of improvement for route planning and
staff training.
● Finch West route experiences the most delays
mainly caused by diversions, identifying areas
for improvement.
● West bound buses experience the most delays.
● There are more delays during the weekdays as
compared to weekends.
● Delays fluctuate over the months, decreasing
during February and April, and increasing during
May and August.

Conclusion:
Overall, it appears that Diversions and Mechanical
problems causes the most delays, with delays being
significantly high during January and August.
It appears that in January possibly harsh weather
conditions contribute to increased delays. Whereas in
August possibly construction and high influx of people due
to tourism and school reopening contribute to increase
delays.

Future Consideration:
It would be interesting to analyze specific times of the
day to identify possible patterns causing delays.
It would be interesting to explore the ridership and TTC
bus revenue data to understand how bus delay have an
impact on the business.
